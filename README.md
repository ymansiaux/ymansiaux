Welcome to my GitHub account !

I am currently working at Bordeaux Métropole, as a Data Scientist.

I have a PhD in biostatistics, applied to the epidemiology of H1N1 influenza. 

My language of choice is R, but I hope getting better at using other languages in 2022 (Javascript 🙏) as well as improving my dataviz skills.

You will find here some repositories 

On this github profile, you will find some repositories in which I am trying to improve my coding skills, but other tools that might be useful to you :

* 📦 xtradata : a R package allowing to send request to Bordeaux Métropole Open Data APIs
* 📦 leaflettools : a R package in which I am trying to add new functionnalities to draw leaflet maps
* 📦 shinyYM : a R package with some additionnal features for shiny (e.g. use of the notie JS library notifications)
* 🕸️ datalabsite : website of the Bordeaux Métropole datalab (made with Hugo and blogdown)

Feel free to contact me if you have questions on these (or others) tools ! 😃

Yohann
