Welcome to my GitHub account !

I am currently working at ThinkR, as a developer and R trainer.

I have a PhD in biostatistics, applied to the epidemiology of H1N1 influenza. 

I fell into the R world in 2008, and since then have never stopped using this language for all types of data I had to work with. Whether it is to explore genomic data, map transportation networks or model epidemiological indicators, R has always been my faithful companion.
For a long time I focused on statistical models, but my use of R has gradually expanded, with a strong taste for data visualization and the development of Shiny applications.

At ThinkR, I will be able to continue to explore the infinite fields of application of R and transmit my knowledge with enthusiasm.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions ! ðŸ˜ƒ

Yohann
