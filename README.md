Welcome to my GitHub account !

I am currently working at ThinkR, as a developer and R trainer.

I have a PhD in biostatistics, applied to the epidemiology of H1N1 influenza. 

My language of choice is R, but I hope getting better at using other languages in 2023 (Javascript 🙏) as well as improving my dataviz skills.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions on these (or others) tools ! 😃

Yohann
